- Current:

We currently are polishing the implementation of A (low level detail view), C (attribute component), and D (selection component). 
The interface for these parts are mostly done; users can now create different selection windows. 

There is no limitation on the number of the windows that can be created.
however, it takes more resources to render and build edges as the number of windows increase.
The selecion windows can be marked with different colors and are draggable.
Also three types of edges can be built, and they can be colored based on the window it connects.
We are still working on connecting these parts together. 

- Next step:

1) For part A, we want to be able to modify and delete the selection window after its creation and to be able resize it.
2) Also, there still are some problems with the background edge rendering (edges connect airports inside of the selection widow and ouside airports).
3) Connect part A with the selection component (part C).
4) Build up Part B (high-level overview).
